    # ☁️ AWS Cloud Fundamentals — Notes

   ## Key Cloud Concepts
   - **Scalability:** Automatically handle more users or requests.
   - **Elasticity:** Scale resources up or down as needed.
   - **High Availability:** Minimize downtime across multiple regions.
   - **Security:** Shared responsibility model — AWS secures the cloud, you secure what’s in it.

## AWS Core Services
| Service | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| EC2 | Virtual servers for compute power |
| S3 | Object storage for files and data |
| RDS | Managed relational databases |
| IAM | Identity & Access Management |
| CloudWatch | Monitoring and alerts |
| Lambda | Run code without managing servers |

---

## Cost and Pricing
- **Pay-as-you-go model**
- **Free Tier** gives 12 months of limited usage
- Use **AWS Pricing Calculator** to estimate monthly costs

---

## My Takeaway
AWS services are deeply interconnected — understanding how they fit together is key to designing efficient systems.
